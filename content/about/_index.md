Astro Garden is my personal gallery website for showcasing my astrophotography work. I started astrophotography in May of 2021 with a Nikon D5500 and a tripod. Now, I've got a dedicated astrophotography rig at [Starfront Remote Observatories](https://starfront.space) in Texas. This site is the only place you can view my photos at full resolution for free.
